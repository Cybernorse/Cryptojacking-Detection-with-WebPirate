# Crytojacking-Malware-detection-with-web-pirate
# Web Pirate a command line tool written in python3.7 for detecting cryptojacking malware is based on web crawler
# Download it using "git clone https://github.com/Cybernorse/Crytojacking-Malware-detection-with-web-pirate.git"
# Installing it is as easy as "python3.7 setup.py install" 
# you can install requirements by "python3.7 -m pip install -r requirements.txt" but above command will install them too.
# And if you are somehow unable to install dependencies successfully and failed to use the tool then you can simply do "python3.7 detective_pirate.py [URL]" and it will work fine as well, same goes if you install it successfully 
# NOTE : You must use this tool by moving to its directory (/home/desktop/Downloads/Crytojacking-Malware-detection-with-web-pirate) or else it will never work properly.
# soon I will launch python module for cryptojacking purposes.
