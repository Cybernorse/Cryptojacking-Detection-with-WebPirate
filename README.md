# Crytojacking-Malware-detection-with-web-pirate
# Web Pirate a command line tool written in python3.7 for detecting cryptojacking malware is based on web crawler
# Download it using "git clone https://github.com/Cybernorse/Crytojacking-Malware-detection-with-web-pirate.git"
# Installing it is as easy as "python3.7 setup.py install" 
# you can install requirements by "python3.7 -m pip install -r requirements.txt" but above command will install them too.
# And if you are somehow unable to install dependencies successfully and failed to use the tool then you can simply do "python3.7 detective_pirate.py [URL]" and it will work fine as well, same goes if you install it successfully but you wouldn't need to put "python3.7" then.
# NOTE : You must use this tool by moving to its directory for example (/home/desktop/Downloads/Crytojacking-Malware-detection-with-web-pirate) or else it will never work properly.
# This tool depends on the database bigger than Dr mines (inbrowser cryptojacking detection tool in node js) database, it will provide infecting url only if they are found in the database too. 
# Though their is alot of room for it to improve and i will do my best to improve it even more.
# soon I will launch python module for cryptojacking purposes.
